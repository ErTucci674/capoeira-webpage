# Capoeira - Website üóî
Learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript through my first website

## About the Project üìñ
In 2023 I took an online Computer Science course with Harvard University. One of the tasks was to put in practice the knowledge I have acquired of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to design and develop my first website.
Among the several sub-tasks, I needed to use the CSS Framework Bootstrap and make it adjustable and responsive for "any device" user. Hence, I have decided to make a website related to one of my hobbies, Capoeira.

The website includes four pages:
+ **Home** - A brief about Capoeira and what it is
+ **History** - Some history of Capoeira
+ **Shop** - A sale page where to buy Capoeira clothes, instruments and accessories 
+ **Movements** - Explaining the Capoeira basic movements; Short _stance_ tutorial

Each web page incorporates a header and a footer with a nagivation bar that allows the user to switch through the different pages and headings.
**Important**: the shop is not connected to any actual sale website -> when the buy button is clicked an "out of stock" text appears.

## Built with ‚å®Ô∏è
+ HTML/CSS
+ JavaScript

## Getting Started üóî
You can click the following link to open the GitHub web page: https://ertucci674.github.io/capoeira-webpage/

Otherwise, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ErTucci674/capoeira-webpage.git
```
Then, all you need is to keep all of the files\folders in the same folder and open the _index.html_ file (home page) with any Browser.

## Project Review and Roadmap üë£
In this experience I have learnt the basics of Web designing and web development. Among these:
+ Page Structure - HTML
+ Page Aesthetics - CSS
+ Animations/Interactions - CSS/JavaScript
+ User Responsiveness - CSS/JavaScript

If I had to approach this project again, I would re-design the aesthetics and user interactive interface on smaller devices such as phones and ipads. The current structure allows small updatable changes and no much "future proof" reliability.

In future updates an improvement that could be integrated would be the "auto" creation of similar web pages. In other words, avoding the repeatition of code. I personally know that _Python_ and its web framework _Flask_ would do the job. However, as my Course Task was mainly focused on the basic development of a website, _Flask_ was not introduced yet.
